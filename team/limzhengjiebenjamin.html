<p>This portfolio documents my contributions towards the UltiStudent project
which is part of an introductory software engineering module known as <strong>CS2103T - Software Engineering</strong>.
During this module, we have been provided with a working software application
that could enhance and morph our application to suit our target audience.</p>
</div>

<p>The purpose of this document is to present the principles and practical skills
I have learnt throughout the course of this module.</p>

<p><strong>UltiStudent</strong> is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. Having a large number of different platforms can lead to inconvenience, incompatibilities
and inorganisation. <strong>UltiStudent</strong> tackles this problem by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, Cumulative Average Point (CAP) and notes to improve the quality of their school life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>UltiStudent</strong> provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for students to interact with and is complemented by a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). We have designed the application with the user in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developed the <code>Model</code>, <code>Logic</code> and <code>Storage</code> infrastructure for the Homework Manager.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Allows the user to <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>find</code> and <code>list</code> in the homework entries. Provides the
foundations on which these features are built.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The ability to create homework entries and other features such as edit depends on the Homework Manager
infrastructure. This enhances the features of the UltiStudent by allowing students
to manage their homework on our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> This enhancement is a core component of our application. It affects the current functionalities of our
application and the future extensions of our application. To do this well, it requires an in-depth understanding of the
initial infrastructure of the software in order to alter it. The implementation was also difficult because of the various abstraction
layers that had to be understood.</p>

indicated by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>edit-homework INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [hw/HOMEWORK] [d/DEADLINE]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Realised that you made a mistake in an entry after you added it? Introducing our edit command!
You can make any changes to any of the attributes of the homework entry using this command!<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use this command, we must follow this format: <code>edit-homework INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [hw/HOMEWORK]
[d/DEADLINE]</code> You can refer to the diagram below to understand what we mean by the word <code>index</code>!
You may have noticed that it looks rather similar to the add-hw command. Good observation!
However, you should take note of the slight difference that you do not have to include all the attributes.
Instead, only include those you wish to change. Any other attribute(s) is optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at an example so that you can understand what I mean more clearly.
So you already have a homework entry in the homework manager which has these
<code>mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019</code> as its attributes.
Now let&#8217;s say our professor has decided to extend the deadline by a week upon requests by students.
Simply type <code>edit-hw 1 d/08/05/2019</code> and the update will be reflected in your homework entry.</p>

<p>After entering your <code>edit-hw</code> command, the message you see in the green highlighted box
in the diagram above indicates that you have successfully done it.
You can also see how the deadline of the attribute has been updated according to the deadline you wish to edit it to.</p>

For each step, you may follow the activity diagram at the end of this section to better understand the flow of events
within UltiStudent when an <code>edit-hw</code> command is inputted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application and opens the homework manager. There is a list of existing homework entries
in the homework manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user then wishes to alter the homework deadline of the third entry in the homework list to 10 May 2019.
He then types <code>edit-hw d/10/05/2019</code> into the Command Line Interface (CLI) and executes it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The UltiStudentParser (refer to <a href="#Design-Logic"><strong>logic</strong></a>) then reads in these attributes that have been inputted
and proceeds to alter the attributes of the homework entry in the given index. Each attribute will be validated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The UltiStudentParser then creates a new EditHomeworkCommand based on the input of the user.
When the EditHomeworkCommand is executed, it interacts with the Model architecture by calling the setHomework method.
The setHomework method replaces the current homework entry with the a new homework entry
containing all the desired attributes. The homework entry is now updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. If the module code for any homework entry has been edited to a module code that is not in the module code list,
the EditHomeworkCommand will add the new module code into the module code list.
The updated module code list will be displayed on our User Interface.</p>

<p>The <code>FindModuleCommandParser</code> implements <code>Parser</code> with the following operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>FindModuleCommandParser#parse()</code> - This operation will take in at least one <code>String</code> input from the
user and display any of the homework entries with matches any of list of <code>[KEYWORDS]</code> that the user has inputted.
Each keyword is separated by a white space.
Any homework entry that matches with the list of keywords will be displayed on the homework list.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The find module feature is facilitated by the <code>FindModuleCommand</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a sequence of steps on how the find module feature works. We will use an example here to help you understand the
flow of events. In the steps below, we will make references to the diagram at the end of the section to help
you visualise the sequence of events better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user first launches the application and enters the homework manager. There are already existing
homework entries within the homework list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. Currently, there are a total of twelve homework entries belonging to four modules.
(Do note that this is an arbitrary state of the storage in the homework manager and is meant to serve as an example.)
Now the user inputs <code>find mod CS1101S</code>. Referring to the diagram below, UltiStudentCommandParser
parses the command <code>find-mod</code> together with the list of keywords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The FindModuleParser then creates a FindModuleCommand and then returns it to the LogicManager,
which are illustrated by the blue arrows pointing from the command parsers back to the LogicManger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. Now, the Logic Manager then executes this command. When the find command is executed, it called the method
updateFilteredList, which then returns a list of homework that has the module codes which matches any of the key words
inputted back to the Logic Manager as indicated by the purple arrows pointing back to the Logic Manager&#8217;s blue block.</p>
